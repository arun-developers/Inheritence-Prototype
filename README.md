# Inheritence-Prototype

I have created the custome Array with the help of JavaScript.

I have learned the new things in this topic and i have to realize how javascript work behind the browser.

Custome array give me the overview to better understang to learn the javascript in depth.

In this topic I have to use constructor function of javascript which is very usefull to create custome array.

I have to create the custome Function like push(),pop(),top(),reverse() etc

---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

I have create the object which have the inheritence property and i have use this property to create Inheritance .

Inheritance ;-   That takes all the functionality from a parent class and allows you to add more.

                 It has to have the exact name "constructor".
                 
                 It is executed automatically when a new object is created.
                 
                 It is used to initialize object properties.
